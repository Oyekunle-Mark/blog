            <p>I had a basic system for sharing config files across the machines I work on. I have written about how I use a <a href="{{&lt; ref &quot;/posts/keep-configs-in-sync.md&quot; &gt;}}">simple git workflow</a> to share the same files on different machines along with a tiny script to set up new machines easily.</p>
<p>That system ran into a wall recently. The main pain points of the old method were:
1. There were utilities I used on one machine that I did not use on the other. My minimalist mindset wants to have the config files for the utilities I use on each machine alone and nothing more.
2. There are frequent cases where configs vary on different machines. A common example is having some aliases for internal tools I use at my 9 to 5 but do not use anywhere else or some initialization script in my <code>.zshrc</code> for utilities that do not exist on another machine.
3. Sensitive information that cannot be added because the config files are checked into git.</p>
<p>Those 3 limitations acted as the requirement for the new changes I had to make. Along with not using any other specific tool, or programming language that doesn't come preinstalled on Unix or Unix-like computers. I also wanted to keep the old simplicity of installing git, pulling the config repositories, executing a script, and being ready to go on any machine after a clean install.</p>
<p>With the requirements established, I will now describe the new system, its usage, and how it solves the problems. This <a href="https://github.com/Oyekunle-Mark/dotfiles">Github repository</a> is where you will find the code being described in this article.</p>
<h2>Building environment-aware config files</h2>
<p>Adding a utility requires adding a new folder for the utility. To onboard a utility <code>xyz</code>, you have to do the following:
1. Add a <code>xyz</code> folder to the root of the repository.
2. Add a <code>common</code> file to the new folder. The <em>common</em> file is where you add the configurations you want to be shared across every machine for this utility.
3. Add a <code>.private</code> file to the folder. This is the file where you add the sensitive configurations, such as personal identifying data. The file is git ignored, so its content will only ever stay on this machine.
4. Register the utility in <code>setup_dotfiles.sh</code> to build the config for the utility.</p>
<p>You will end up with this structure:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>oye@pc<span class="w"> </span>~/my_works/blog<span class="w"> </span>%<span class="w"> </span>lt<span class="w"> </span>-a<span class="w"> </span>xyz
xyz
├──<span class="w"> </span>common
├──<span class="w"> </span>game_machine
└──<span class="w"> </span>.private

<span class="m">1</span><span class="w"> </span>directory,<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">3</span><span class="w"> </span>files
</code></pre></div>

<p>All the magic happens in <code>setup_dotfiles.sh</code>. You register the <code>xyz</code> utility by adding this line to the script:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>build_file<span class="w"> </span>xyz<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">$1</span><span class="w"> </span>~/.xyzrc
</code></pre></div>

<p>Where <code>xyz</code> is the folder the configs were added to in steps 1-3 above, and <code>~/.xyzrc</code> is the file we want as output.</p>
<p>Let's imagine that we are on a machine we refer to as <em>game_machine</em>, we build the config file for <code>xyz</code> on the machine with:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>./setup_dotfiles.sh<span class="w"> </span>game_machine
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>$1</code> argument in the call to <code>build_file</code> earlier will be <em>game_machine</em> in the above script execution.</p>
<p>If <code>xyz</code> has been registered as described above, and <code>setup_dotfiles.sh</code> is executed as described, it follows the following logic to build the config file for the utility:
1. Truncates <code>~/.xyzrc</code> if it exists, otherwise, creates a new empty one.
2. Check if there is a <code>xyz/common</code> file. If there is, it merges it into <code>~/.xyzrc</code>. 
3. Checks for an <code>xyz/game_machine</code> file. If there is, it merges it into <code>~/.xyzrc</code>.
4. Check if an <code>xyz/.private</code> file exists and merges it into <code>~/.xyzrc</code> if it finds one.</p>
<p>What this means is that, for any utility I want configuration provided for, I can:
1. Provide a base configuration that should be present on every machine in <code>common</code>. This is used for those utilities that are a staple no matter the device I am using. Most of the time, this is the only file to add because the files do not change across machines.
2. This allows me to add configurations that are specific to a machine. Or if it is a utility I do not use on all my machines, I just provide a file matching the environment name I will be passing to <code>setup_dotfiles.sh</code> with a <em>common</em> file. Also allows me to vary the generated config file based on a machine, or even have a config file generated on one machine and not on another. As many environment-specific files can be added as an environment using this repository to build configs.
3. Have sensitive information in the config file, by using <code>.private</code>, which doesn't have to make it into git and is isolated to where the file is added.</p>
<p>All files are optional, which means you only create what you need, and <code>setup_dotfiles.sh</code> only builds what your environment needs.</p>

<p>You can see the tool reports what it uses and ignores as it generates each utility config file.</p>
<p>Updates are checked into <em>git</em> and kept in sync across machines by push and pull to and from the remote repository.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The current setup described satisfies my current use cases. It will be interesting to see how long that lasts until it becomes obsolete and how I evolve the repository while keeping to my principle of not using more complex tools than I need.</p>
<p>While there are several tools out there for managing config files, this bespoke solution scratches my itch and needs just a git installation(if it already did not exist) on any machine to get up and running.</p>
