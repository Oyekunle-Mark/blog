Balancing professional and personal commitments requires a decent grasp on time management. This is something I'm constantly trying to improve. In my years long wrestle with improving my efficiency, I have a few ideas crystallized in my mind. I will, admittedly hapharzadly, list them all out as bullet points:

- To be more effective, it is about what you do not do. You have to say no more.
- You do not need more time, you need less distraction. Cut out the distractions, and you become more efficient.
- Focus on doing a few things really well. Versus doing many things passably. You can only do a few things. Pick your battles. Prioritize and let the rest go.
- Everyting you say yes to takes time away from another things you would otherwise be doing.
- Relentlessly prioritize. As you grow as a professional, must aggressively prioritize.
- You won't get more time. You cannot control that anyway. Focus on what you can control, which is, how you use your time.

I have settled on an analogy that helps me wrap all the above points in context. My attention is like a school bag. There is a fixed amount of items it can carry. When this bag is filled, I have to take something out before I can put something else in. That succintly wraps it up.
