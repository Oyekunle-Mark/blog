I am still new to photography. So, I naturally went looking for resources to provide the basics I needed to independently use my digital camera. The first such resource was the [Photo Class](http://www.r-photoclass.com/) website. That website provided the helped me understand and apply the fundmental photography concepts like the Exposure Triangle and image processing.

After working through Photo Class, I bought and read Henry Carroll's [Read This if You Want to Take Great Photographs](https://amzn.eu/d/88I2Rxw). I will be reviewing the book in this post.

While Photo Class is skewed towards Light, Read This if You Want to Take Great Photographs strikes a balance between Composition, Light, Color and Inspiration. The very cornerstone of photograph. It's treatment of these topics are elementary, but it does enough to leave the reader if an impression of how much should go into making a great photograph, and that the art would be a personal one for the beginer.

Its treatment of composition follows the popular 10 rules of composition. So, it doesn't provide insight you wouldn't find anywhere else on the internet. Where the book was particularly illuminating for me was how it presented Light: Soft vs Hard, the distinctions and interpretations each gives a photograph.

The two last chapters of the book, Seeing and Feeling, were also topics I hadn't encountered in my fledgling hobby. As you would expect, the chapters were about the artistic and creative process of how master photographers see and feel. They were a lot more personal, compared to the previous chapters that were more cookie-cutter.

Overall, Read This if You Want to Take Great Photographs provided the most balanced introductory treatment of photography than I could find anywhere on the internet. This is in no way an endorsement that the book is the best for it's target audience, it just so happen to be the best I could findon introductory photography.
