I am still new to photography, so I naturally went looking for resources that would provide the basics I needed to use my digital camera independently. The first such resource was the [Photo Class](http://www.r-photoclass.com/) website. That website helped me understand and apply fundamental photography concepts like the Exposure Triangle and image processing.

After working through the Photo Class website, I bought and read Henry Carroll's [Read This if You Want to Take Great Photographs](https://amzn.eu/d/88I2Rxw). I will review the book in this post.

While Photo Class is skewed towards Light, Read This if You Want to Take Great Photographs strikes a balance between Composition, Light, Color and Inspiration. The cornerstones of photography. Its treatment of these topics is elementary, but it does enough to leave the reader with an impression of how much should go into making a great photograph, and that the journey to mastery would be a personal one.

Its treatment of composition follows the popular 10 rules of composition. It doesn't provide insight you wouldn't find anywhere else on the internet. Where the book was particularly illuminating for me was how it presented Light: Soft vs Hard, the distinctions and interpretations each gives a photograph.

The two last chapters of the book, Seeing and Feeling were also topics I hadn't encountered in my fledgling hobby. As you would expect, these chapters were about the artistic and creative process of how master photographers see and feel. They were a lot more personal compared to the previous chapters which were more cookie-cutter.

Overall, Read This if You Want to Take Great Photographs provided the most balanced introductory treatment of photography that I could find anywhere on the internet.
