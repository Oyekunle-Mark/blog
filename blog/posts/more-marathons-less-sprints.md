Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

When you are learning something new, prefer frequent smaller learning time-slots with as little days of inactivity as possible. This yields better result than isolated days of big leaps in advancement that require major efforts.

Learning and personal development is a marathon, not a sprint. Consistency is the ultimate strategy. When you have a great distance to cover, you are better of walking, not sprinting.

Consistency compounds while occasional brilliance fades.
