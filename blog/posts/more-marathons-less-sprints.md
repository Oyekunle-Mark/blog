Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.

When learning something new, choose daily manageable learning timeslots. This yields better results than isolated days of big progress followed by days of inactivity.

Learning and personal development is a marathon, not a sprint. Consistency is the ultimate strategy. When you have a great distance to cover, you are better off walking, not sprinting.

Consistency compounds while occasional brilliance fades.
