Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

When learning something new, choose a daily manageable learning time-slots. This yields better result than isolated days of big progress followed by days of inactivity.

Learning and personal development is a marathon, not a sprint. Consistency is the ultimate strategy. When you have a great distance to cover, you are better off walking, not sprinting.

Consistency compounds while occasional brilliance fades.
