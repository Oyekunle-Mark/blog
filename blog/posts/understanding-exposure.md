I have written in the past about my fledgling photography hobby. To continue my learning to become a better photographer, I picked and read a copy of Bryan Peterson's [Understanding Exposure](https://amzn.eu/d/gFaZUa3). I'm writing this post after finishing the book and going on a few camera walks to put some of the learnings into practice.

This book comes highly recommended on the photography forums I frequent(primarily Reddit!), and I see why now. I can't find a better resource anywhere that expounds the 'Exposure Triangle' in such a manner that will leave the reader ready to set out and make exposures in Manual mode.

I do not know how comprehensive a treatment of the subject of exposure the book is, given I am still green myself, but it is comprehensive enough to demystify manual mode. A beginner who reads the book is also going to come away confident with the understanding of what it takes to make the right exposures.

I went out, took some photographs with my camera in manual mode, and was satisfied with the results. This is something I didn't have the confidence(or knowledge) to try before reading Understanding Exposure. There is a curve associated with shooting in manual, but I believe I have the tools to continue shooting like until I have internalized the basics.

In conclusion, this is a book I will recommend to every beginner. Even if you have some understanding of the Exposure Triangle, Bryan's treatment of the topic is guaranteed to leave you a better photographer. 5 stars, this one!
