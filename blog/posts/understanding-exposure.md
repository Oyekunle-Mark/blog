I have written in the past about my fledgling photography hobby. To continue my learning to become a better photographer, I picked and read a copy of Bryan Peterson's [Understanding Exposure](https://amzn.eu/d/gFaZUa3). I'm writing this post after finishing the book and going on a few camera walks to put some of the learnings into practice.
