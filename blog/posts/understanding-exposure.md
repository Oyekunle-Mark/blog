I have written about my fledgling photography hobby in the past. To continue learning to become a better photographer, I read a copy of Bryan Peterson's [Understanding Exposure](https://amzn.eu/d/gFaZUa3). I'm writing this post after finishing the book and going out on a few camera walks to put some of the learnings into practice.

The book is frequently recommended on the photography forums I frequent(primarily Reddit!), and I see why now. I can't find a better resource anywhere that expounds the [Exposure Triangle](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/understanding-exposure-part-1-the-exposure-triangle) in such a manner that will leave the reader ready to set out and make exposures in manual mode.

Shooting in manual isn't a measure of one's understanding of the rudiments of photography. Some photographers are elitist about this point being a yardstick of sorts. In this post, I am referring to shooting in manual as a reflection of my understanding of the exposure triangle. After all, a Chinese proverb goes: "I hear and I forget, I see and I remember, I do and I understand."

I do not know how comprehensive a treatment of the subject of exposure the book is, given I am still green, but it is detailed enough to demystify manual mode. A beginner who reads the book will come away confident with the understanding of what it takes to make the right exposures.

I took some photographs with my camera in manual mode and was satisfied with the results. I didn't have the confidence to do this before reading Understanding Exposure. There is a curve associated with shooting in manual, but I believe I have the tools to continue shooting like this until I have internalised the basics.

In conclusion, this is a book I will recommend to every beginner. Even if you have some understanding of the Exposure Triangle, Bryan's treatment of the topic is guaranteed to leave you a better photographer. 5 stars, this one!
