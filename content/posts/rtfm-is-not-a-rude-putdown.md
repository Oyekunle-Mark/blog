**RTFM!** The initialism that always comes across as a rebuff to a query. I have done a few Google searches on the topic, so why is *user_xyz* under the assumption that I want to be spoonfed?

A sequence of carefully crafted Google searches, followed by reading the most promising articles returned by the search isn't a replacement for reading the documentation. Neither is tinkering with the library for hours. This fact is even more glaring in some kind of development than others.

I dabled into a little operating system developement recently, and the importance of reading the official documentation of the technology I was working  was impressed upon me more than at any time because of how much clarity I took away from carefully consuming the *Multiboot Specification* compared to the fuzzy state of mind I was when I was going on just reading x86 assembly multiboot and reading responses in forums about what multiboot is.

I let that spur me on and read the find print of every other tool I needed. I wouldn't just copy that linker script and tinker with it, I will read the *GNU Linker Command Language* documentation instead. As you would expect, my experience was so much more pleasant with this documentation first approach. RTFMing is another of those engineering truism. We know them, but we do them not.

The next time I came across a response that nudged me to RTFM, I was gracious. No more would I consider it a rebuttal by masochists. The documentation/specification/manual of that topic you're struggling with provides the clarity you need, save yourself the Google searches, articles, forum questions, trials and errors. RTFM is not a rude response, it's the gospel.

> (n * 60) minutes of debugging can save your n minutes of reading the documentation.
