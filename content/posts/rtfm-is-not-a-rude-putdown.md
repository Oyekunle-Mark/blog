RTFM! The initialism that always comes across as a rebuff to a query. I have done a few Google searches on the topic, so why is *user_xyz* under the assumption that I want to be spoonfed?

It turns out that a sequence of carefully crafted Google searches, followed by reading the most promising articles returned by the search isn't a replacement for reading the documentation. Neither is tinkering with the library for hours. This fact is even more glaring in some kind of development than others.

> n * 60 minutes of debugging can save your n minutes of reading the documentation.
