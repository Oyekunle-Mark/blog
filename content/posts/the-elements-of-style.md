After [[Reviewing "How to Take Smart Notes" by Sonke Ahrens]], I started with the book [The Elements of Style](https://amzn.eu/d/0ct5zf7z). Starting my Focus on the **Elementary Principles of Composition** section of book.

Some of rules described here are echoed in this [article](https://evaparish.com/blog/how-i-edit?utm_source=pocket_shared). The article delivers so much value without losing conciseness.

## Principles of Composition
##### Choose a destination before starting
You should write with an end in sight. You choose the topic,  structure, what you wish to say, and how you would say. And work to meet these goal. Not in all cases will writing require a scheme to be set out. But in most cases, you should start with a plan.

> Determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape.

The more clearly you envision this shape, the better your chances of delivering a quality writing.

##### Use paragraphs as a unit of composition
Discuss a single topic in a paragraph. The paragraph signals to the reader that a new piece of the development is being introduced. It is recommended that the first sentence in the paragraph introduces/suggests the topic of the paragraph, or help transition into the topic.

##### Use the active voice
The active voice should be used over the passive voice. Active voice is clearer and more indicative of subject(who performed an action). By extension active sentences are also shorter. **TODO**: Find examples of this

##### Put statements in positive form
Avoid negative statements(with the use of not). Readers do not want to be told what is not, but what is. using negative statements make you sound unathoritative and shows you lack a command of the content. Avoid auxiliaries like would, should, could, may, might and can. Save them for real uncertainties.

##### Use definite, specific, concrete language
Be specific instead of general, definite instead of vague, concrete instead of abstract.
It is here that the writer introduces *writing with vigour*. Definite, specific and concrete language add vigour to writing.
##### Omit needless words
The most famous brutal principle yet. The author states that a sentence should have no needless word. A paragraph no needless sentence. The same  way a painting does not have an unnecessary line, and a machine no unnecessary parts.

This conciseness also contributes to this concept of *vigorous writing* the writer stated in the last rule.

##### Express coordinate ideas in similar forms
The Beatitudes(in the Christian Bible) was given as an example of this **parallel construction**. 

##### Keep to one tense
This I have to remember.

## An Approach to style - List of reminders
This is a list of reminders, in verbatim, at the end of the book
1. **Place yourself in the background.**
2. **Write in a way that comes naturally to you.** This means to try not to imitate style. Your style will emerge if you write well.
3. **Work from a suitable design**. This is the same *Choose a destination before starting* rule from *Principles of Composition* above.
4. **Write with nouns and verbs**. Avoid adverbs and adjectives
5. **Revise and rewrite**. Duh.
6. **Do not overwrite**. I am guilty of this one.
7. **Do not overstate**. Equally guilty.
8. **Avoid the use of qualifiers**. Yes, the book is very prescriptive. *Rather, very, little, pretty* are examples of the qualifiers.
9. **Do not explain too much**.
10. **Do not construct awkward adverbs**. Avoid adding *-ly* to adjectives. Damn!
11. **Avoid fancy words**
12. **Be clear**
13. **Do not inject opinion**. I am opinionated. So, this should have been in written in all caps.

## Conclusion
It is hard for me to be concrete when giving an opinion here. There are a few inconsistencies in the book. Example, there that states "statements containing parentheses should be punctuated outside the last mark of the parentheses". In the next rule, the example broke this rule. There are more examples of the author violating their own rules.

I liked the *Principles of Composition* section. The reader will find a lot of rules to improve their writings there.

The *List of reminders* acted as some form of reinforcement of previous rules, and a means of introducing new ones. I picked up some new useful advises there as well.

In summary, the book is a good read, considering it took me less than 6 hours to consume the content I found interesting.
