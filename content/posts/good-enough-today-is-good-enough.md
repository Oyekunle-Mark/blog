The choice of when, and what to deliver is one you will face often. Choose to deliver a good enough solution as soon as you can compared to taking more time to deliver a great solution at a later time.

There will always be an endless list of important things to work on. You won't ever be able to finish them all. You typically start with the most importan thing, and work your way down your to-do list. Using this method, do not obsess over perfecting each deliverable. Work them into a state where they are good enough, and move on.

The time gained in having delivered to users early is the gain in this paradigm. It's a speed-quality tradeoffs.

Taking that extra time to shoe-horn the solution into the best possible shape is not necessarily the best approach in the long run.

When it meets the requirement, deliver.
<br/>
Move on.
<br/>
Iterate over it if modifications or improvements are required.

Trading a bit of quality for speed allows you to work towards your global maximum instead of a local maximum.
