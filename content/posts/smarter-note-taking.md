A Software Engineer is a [knowledge worker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker). Software Engineering requires constant learning. I heard about the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method and wanted to learn more about the process to incorporate it into my workflow. [How to Take Smart Notes](https://amzn.eu/d/06pomukl) by Sonke Ahrens was recommended as a text for learning the method, so I picked up a copy. This article is my opinion and takeaway from the book.

At its core, **How to Take Smart Notes** is a Zettelkasten manual. Zettelkasten is a note-taking method that involves linking related notes and ideas together. This definition is a simplification, and I  recommend you read the [Zettelkasten Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) page a read. I consider the Zettelkasten method a rigorous implementation of link-based note-taking.

The main steps of maintaining a Zettelkasten are:
1. Taking fleeting notes. About thoughts and ideas you have. Carry a notebook around if you have to.
2. Making literature references. You will build a reference system for your main ideas.
3. Making permanent notes. Which might be:
	1. An expansion of a fleeting note
	2. A standalone note
	3. A follow-up to another note
4. Link notes to related notes.

The Zettelkasten is a mind map. You expand it as you learn. Having your related notes linked together allows you to build insights better, develop ideas incrementally, and have a base system for writing publications based on your notes.

The Zettelkasten method itself is simple. The author spent the rest of the pages on a stream of recommendations and justification of why one should learn with a pen and take notes **during** learning.

Some of these recommendations are:
- **You can't think without writing**: This is a quote by the creator of the Zettelkasten system, Niklas Luhmann.
- **Never starting from scratch**: The Zettelkasten system builds a body of notes from your learning. So you always have a trove of thoughts to begin with as drafts
- **Writing should accompany learning**: Repeated in several different ways throughout the text. Writing reinforces the ideas learned and ensures you understand and internalise them before moving on.
- **Do not let ideas go to waste**: Capture ideas when you have them. Anywhere, anytime.
- **Read with a pen in hand**: This one is my favourite.

The book has left me with a resolution to take better notes. I recommend every knowledge worker read the book. You need not implement the Zettelkasten method expounded in the book. Taking notes while you learn, along with software that lets you link the notes will improve the workflow of anyone who doesn't do them already.
