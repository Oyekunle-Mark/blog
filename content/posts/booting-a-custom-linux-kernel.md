You will expect to run a program after making changes to it. The same is expected even when hacking on a real kernel. This article will document how to install the required packages, build and run the Linux on QEMU and natively on your local Linux host.
I will be using  a Debian distribution to run all commands provided, you might need to modify them if you are using an non-debian based distribution.

## Install the required packages

## Build the kernel

## QEMU boot

## Running natively
