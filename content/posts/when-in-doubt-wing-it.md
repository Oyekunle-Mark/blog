This post is another monologue note.

When in doubt, wing it. There wouldn't always be a guide or manual for the action you wish to perform. You might find there are no guardrails provided. In these moments, wing it!

Winging it allows you to leverage your experiences up to that point. The body of knowledge you have acquired will guide you. So go forth in silent confidence. Make the best decision you can at every point on the way.

As you grow, you will find yourself in positions where there is little to no hand-holding. This is an indication that you are leaving the crowd behind. Let the resilience that brought you here guide you on.

You don't need a manual.
