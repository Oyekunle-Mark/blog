Producing code comes with costs. No matter how good the code you added was. You must not presume there are only positives to problem solving by introducing new code.

The most obvious burden of code addition is maintenance. This new repository the code was added to will need to be maintained, or it has increased the maintenance effort of the existing repository it was added to. If the code you are writing is being added to an existing codebase, the effort required to make future changes might have increased because larger codebases are more difficult to work on.

Another burden is context. You just added another thing that your team mates have to build context in. The effort to ramp-up has also increased a notch for new engineers.

Also, there is a good chance that you just introduced new bugs by shipping code.

This post was written to reinforce upon myself that writing code is done at a cost.
