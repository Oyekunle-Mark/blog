There is a cost attached to adding new code. No matter how good the code you are adding. We must not presume there are only positives to our problem solving by introducing new code.

The most obvious burden of code addition is maintenance. Now, this new piece of code will need to be maintained too, or it has increased the maintenance effort of the repository it was added to.

Then there is context. You just added another thing that your team mates have to build context in. The effort to ramp has also increased a notch for new engineers.

Your new code will also introduced, or increase the bug count.

This post was written to reinforce upon myself the need to take these costs into consideration.
