## Exploring the linux kernel sources

```sh
cd /linux_work
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git linux_mainline
cd linux_mainline; ls -h
```

You can prepare a patch for any commit using:

```sh
git format-patch 1 <commit-id>
```

## Building and installing the kernel

Starting out with the distribution configuration file is the safest approach for the very first kernel install on any system

```sh
cp /boot/config-6.1.0-21-amd64 .config
```

### Compiling the kernel

Run the following command to generate a kernel configuration file based on the current configuration. This step is important to configure the kernel, which has a good chance to work correctly on your system. You will be prompted to tune the configuration to enable new features and drivers that have been added since Ubuntu snapshot the kernel from the mainline. `make all` will invoke `make oldconfig` in any case. I am showing these two steps separately just to call out the configuration file generation step.

```sh
make oldconfig
```

Another way to trim down the kernel and tailor it to your system is by using `make localmodconfig`. This option creates a configuration file based on the list of modules currently loaded on your system.

```sh
lsmod > /tmp/my-lsmod
make LSMOD=/tmp/my-lsmod localmodconfig
```

Once this step is complete, it is time to compile the kernel. Using the `-j` option helps the compiles go faster. The `-j` option specifies the number of jobs (make commands) to run simultaneously:

```sh
make -j3 all
```

### Installing the new kernel

Once the kernel compilation is complete, install the new kernel:

su -c "make modules_install install"

The above command will install the new kernel and run update-grub to add the new kernel to the grub menu. Now it is time to reboot the system to boot the newly installed kernel. Before we do that, let's save logs from the current kernel to compare and look for regressions and new errors, if any. Using the -t option allows us to generate dmesg logs without the timestamps, and makes it easier to compare the old and the new.

dmesg -t > dmesg_current
dmesg -t -k > dmesg_kernel
dmesg -t -l emerg > dmesg_current_emerg
dmesg -t -l alert > dmesg_current_alert
dmesg -t -l crit > dmesg_current_crit
dmesg -t -l err > dmesg_current_err
dmesg -t -l warn > dmesg_current_warn
dmesg -t -l info > dmesg_current_info

In general, dmesg should be clean, with no emerg, alert, crit, and err level messages. If you see any of these, it might indicate some hardware and/or kernel problem.

If the dmesg_current is zero length, it is very likely that secure boot is enabled on your system. When secure boot is enabled, you won’t be able to boot the newly installed kernel, as it is unsigned. You can disable secure boot temporarily on startup with MOK manager. Your system should already have mokutil.

Let's first make sure secure boot is indeed enabled:

mokutil --sb-state

If you see the following, you are all set to boot your newly installed kernel:

SecureBoot disabled
Platform is in Setup Mode

If you see the following, disable secure boot temporarily on startup with MOK manager:

SecureBoot enabled
SecureBoot validation is disabled in shim

Disable validation:

sudo mokutil --disable-validation
root password
mok password: 12345678
mok password: 12345678
sudo reboot

The machine will reboot in a blue screen, the MOK manager menu. Type the number(s) shown on the screen: if it is 7, it is the 7th character of the password. So, keep 12345678. The question to answer is Yes to disable secure boot. Reboot.

You’ll see on startup after a new message (top left) saying <<Booting in insecure mode>>. The machine will boot normally after and secure boot remains enabled. This change is permanent, a clean install won't overwrite it. You must keep it that way.

To re-enable it (please note that you won't be able to boot the kernels you build if you re-enable):

sudo mokutil --enable-validation
root password
mok password: 12345678
mok password: 12345678
sudo reboot

### Booting the kernel

Booting the Kernel

Let’s take care of a couple of important steps before trying out the newly installed kernel. There is no guarantee that the new kernel will boot. As a safeguard, we want to make sure that there is at least one good kernel installed and we can select it from the boot menu. By default, grub tries to boot the default kernel, which is the newly installed kernel. We change the default grub configuration file /etc/default/grub to the boot menu, and pause for us to be able to select the kernel to boot.

 

🚩
Please note that this option is specific to Ubuntu, and other distributions might have a different way to specify boot menu options.

 

Increase the GRUB_TIMEOUT value to 10 seconds, so grub pauses in menu long enough to choose a kernel to boot:

    Uncomment GRUB_TIMEOUT and set it to 10: GRUB_TIMEOUT=10
    Comment out GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden

If the newly installed kernel fails to boot, it is nice to be able to see the early messages to figure out why the kernel failed to boot.

 

Enable printing early boot messages to vga using the earlyprintk=vga kernel boot option:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="earlyprintk=vga"

 

Run update-grub to update the grub configuration in /boot

sudo update-grub

 

Now, it’s time to restart the system. Once the new kernel comes up, compare the saved dmesg from the old kernel with the new one, and see if there are any regressions. If the newly installed kernel fails to boot, you will have to boot a good kernel, and then investigate why the new kernel failed to boot.​

These steps are not specific to stable kernels. You can check out linux mainline or linux-next and follow the same recipe of generating a new configuration from an oldconfig, build, and install the mainline or linux-next kernels.

## Making changes to a driver

Now, let’s select a driver to make a change. Run lsmod to see the modules loaded on your system, and pick a driver to change. I will walk you through changing the uvcvideo driver. If you don’t have uvcvideo on your system, find a different driver and follow along using your driver name instead of uvcvideo.

Once you have the name of a driver, it's time to find out where the .c and .h files for that driver are in the Linux kernel repository. Even though searching Makefiles will get you the desired result, git grep will get you there faster, searching only the checked-in files in the repository. git grep will skip all generated files such as .o’s, .ko’s and binaries. It will skip the .git directory as well. Okay, now let’s run git grep to look for uvcvideo files.

git grep uvcvideo -- '*Makefile'
drivers/media/usb/uvc/Makefile:uvcvideo-objs := uvc_driver.o uvc_queue.o uvc_v4l2.o uvc_video.o uvc_ctrl.o drivers/media/usb/uvc/Makefile:uvcvideo-objs += uvc_entity.o
drivers/media/usb/uvc/Makefile:obj-$(CONFIG_USB_VIDEO_CLASS) += uvcvideo.o

uvcvideo is a USB Video Class (UVC) media driver for video input devices, such as webcams. It supports webcams on laptops. Let’s check the source files for this driver.

ls drivers/media/usb/uvc/
Kconfig uvc_debugfs.c uvc_isight.c uvc_status.c uvcvideo.h
Makefile uvc_driver.c uvc_metadata.c uvc_v4l2.c
uvc_ctrl.c uvc_entity.c uvc_queue.c uvc_video.c

Let's make a small change to the probe function of the uvcvideo driver. A probe function is called when the driver is loaded. Let's edit uvc_driver.c:

vim drivers/media/usb/uvc/uvc_driver.c

Find the probe function by searching for _probe text by typing / in standard mode. Once you've found the probe function, add pr_info() to it and save the file. A pr_info() function writes a message to the kernel log buffer, and we can see it using dmesg.

static int uvc_probe(struct usb_interface *intf,
                     const struct usb_device_id *id)
{
        struct usb_device *udev = interface_to_usbdev(intf);
        struct uvc_device *dev;
        const struct uvc_device_info *info =
                (const struct uvc_device_info *)id->driver_info;
        int function;
        int ret;

        pr_info("I changed uvcvideo driver in the Linux Kernel\n");

        if (id->idVendor && id->idProduct)
                uvc_trace(UVC_TRACE_PROBE, "Probing known UVC device %s "
                                "(%04x:%04x)\n", udev->devpath, id->idVendor,
                                id->idProduct);
        else
                uvc_trace(UVC_TRACE_PROBE, "Probing generic UVC device %s\n",
                                udev->devpath);​

Let’s try configuring uvcvideo as a built-in and as a module to play with installing, loading and unloading modules.

Configure as a module:

    Configure CONFIG_USB_VIDEO_CLASS=y
    Recompile your kernel and install. Please note that you don't have to reboot your system. You can load your newly installed module.

Load module:

    sudo modprobe uvcvideo
    Once you load the module, let's check if you see your message.
    Run dmesg | less and search for "I changed". Do you see the message?
    Run lsmod | grep uvcvideo. Do you see the module?

Unload module:

    sudo rmmod uvcvideo
    Check dmesg for any messages about the uvcvideo module removal.
    Run lsmod | grep uvcvideo. Do you see the module?

Configure Built-in:

    Configure CONFIG_USB_VIDEO_CLASS=y
    Recompile your kernel, install, and reboot the system into the newly installed kernel.
    Run dmesg | less and search for "I changed". Do you see the message?
