I had [previously written]({{< ref "/posts/my-first-foray-into-3d-printing.md" >}}) about getting into 3D printing. In that post, I shared my first prints and what my intentions were for the future. Today, I would be sharing two of my recent prints. The first is a simple laptop holder. The second, my most complex design and print yet, a desk speaker stand.

## Print 1: Laptop Holder

I had purchased a used Lenovo Thinkpad on eBay. I wanted a holder for it so it could sit pretty on my desk. Below is an image of the laptop in all its bland glory:

I came up with an half ellipsoid design for it. Next are images of the laptop holder and how it is placed on my desk with the laptop in it.

## Print 2: Speaker Stands

My speakers are placed behind my monitors. I have a three monitor setup, so I did not have desk space left for them. I wanted a speaker stand that could lift each speaker above the monitors and allow the sounds to be unobstructed by the monitors. The speaker stand itself would be placed on the desk.

This print is the most complex thing I have had to design till date. It presents a number of interesting challenges:
1. The speaker stands cannot be printed once and would have to be split into many parts.
2. I had never designed any part that had joints.
3. Designing such a piece - that does not qualify as simplistic - was challenging for a 3D modelling beginner.

I was able to produce a functional design that used [dovetail joints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dovetail_joint) to join the parts. Here is an image of the parts all printed:

The parts comprise of:
1. A base
2. Stems. This can be joined to lift the speaker to a suitable height.
3. The top. On which the speaker itself would be placed.

The order of assembly is:
1. Join a stem to the base.
2. Optionally, add a number of stems to extend the height of the stand
3. Add the top to the last stem.

It is a simple thing to assemble. Assembly does not require a glue.

To improve the traction the base will have on the desk, I added pads to them. Doing this increases the grip the base has on a smooth surface and improved the overall stability of the structure.

I ran out of spools after printing the parts for the first stand, and only the top of the second. I switched to another spool, of another color, so ended up with a gruesome combination of pink and green parts. I decided to leverage this color imbalance by alternating the colors of the parts during assembly. The chaotic result looked appealing enough to me:

The next pictures are the results of having installed this stands into my workspace.

## Conclusion

This post has shared my recent builds: a laptop holder and a speaker stand. It is always satisfying to solve a need in my own way with the 3D printer. The speaker stand has also allowed me to accomplish my first multi-part build. You can find the STEP files of these parts in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Oyekunle-Mark/3d_models). That repository also contains parts not discussed in this post. You can go ahead and use anything you find interesting. Thank you, for staying with me all the way to the end.
